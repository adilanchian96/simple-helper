# Simple Helper AI System
A simple AI system that will open programs for you using speech-recognition software. Also includes a simple TTS engine.

# How it works
- I used Google's Speech Recognition API and the pyttsx Text-to-speech library to get the TTS engine.
  -For now, it's extremely simple. All it does is asks you to say something, then if you say EXACTLY 'start Safari', it will    start Safari. This helper also only runs on OSX as well. 

# How it will work
- I hope to include multi-platform support, idle-listening, and MUCH more functionality (it will do so much more than opening one application, I promise). I also want to try making a system where multiple phrases will execute the same action. For example, "start Safari", "open Safari", "simple-assistant, look this up for me on Safari", will all start the Safari browser, with the last option passing in parameters to look something up in Safari.
  TLDR: I'm trying to replicate the Alexa system.
  I'm not going to try touching deep-learning yet for this project, but that would definitely be something interesting to look into.
